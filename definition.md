### What is Nudgeware?

**Nudgeware** (n.) is software that changes our default environment to help us live better lives.

Nudgeware is inspired by the concept of a [nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory) in behavioral economics.

The [percentage of our lives that we spend looking at pixels](https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/) is going up and [our relationship with tech is becoming more complex](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/opinion/digital-technology-brain.html).


This means we need a **background layer of software between us and other software we use**, which will help us regulate our usage of that software.

This background layer is called **nudgeware**.


Nudgeware helps us:
- Spend only the amount of time looking at pixels that we intend to
- Check whether that time is making us happy
- Remember alternatives to looking at pixels
- Control the pixels we look at, by removing pixels we don't want


Examples of nudgeware that already exist are:
- Ad blockers like [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/)
- Self control apps like [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/)
- Anti-distraction extensions like [Nudge](http://nudgeware.io/)
