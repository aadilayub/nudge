The Hider now hides more stuff, better</h2><p>I am expanding what the Hider hides, and now there's better coverage for Twitter, Facebook and Buzzfeed, as well as a bunch of new sites hidden such as Vox, CNN, dev.to, Amazon and Cracked, with plenty more on the way.</p><p>You can check out the full list <a href="./hider.html#options" target="_blank">here</a>. (Click 'Show the sections that Nudge hides'.)</p><p>Sections being hidden are now replaced by a light rectangle, and have a button to show what's been hidden (e.g. Show Feed).</p><p>This is so it's more obvious what Nudge has changed on the site, and so that you know what exact sections have been hidden.</p><p>Here's what Twitter now looks like, for example:</p><p class="spacing-m"> </p><img class="preview-image spacing-m" src="../../img/preview/twitter_new_hider.png"/><p class="spacing-m">Don't forget that you need to <a href="./sites.html#options" target="_blank">add a site to your Nudge sites </a>so that the Hider will work on it.</p><h2>2. Nudge is the subject of academic research</h2><p>I've been working with the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland to look into the effectiveness of Nudge's interventions.</p><p>This has led to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3334480.3382810" target="_blank">a short paper </a>about Nudge by Aditya Kumar Purohit at the University of Neuchâtel being accepted to <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/" target="_blank">CHI '20</a>, the world's largest conference about human-computer interaction (thank you Aditya!).</p><p>The paper writes:</p><p>"Our results show that Nudge (1) helped users to become reflective of their social media usage, (2) possibly decreased their time spent, and (3) made the experience more pleasant."</p><p>More to follow, hopefully. Get in touch at my email address below if interested.</p><h2>3. The Unfollower and Facebook Greyifyer are temporarily out of action</h2><p>Facebook updated their site which means I have to figure out new ways of making these two features work.</p><p>Sign up to the mailing list below to stay updated.</p><p>Sorry about this.</p><h2>4. Bug fixes, including one particularly bad one</h2><p>A lot of people complained about their Nudge sites not saving. Sorry about this. Hopefully the problem is now solved for you.</p><p class="spacing">If not, or if there's a different issue bothering you, please submit a bug <a href="https://github.com/lgwb89/nudge/issues" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>.</p><p>***</p><form class="validate" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" action="https://nudgeware.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=8b0fe4a0d9e0cb9ac0d96db09&amp;id=d3b4c5f9ac" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank" novalidate=""><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><div class="mc-field-group"><input class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Type email and press enter to join mailing list" autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" size="40"/></div><div class="clear" id="mce-responses"><div class="response" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="response" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_8b0fe4a0d9e0cb9ac0d96db09_d3b4c5f9ac" tabindex="-1" value=""/></div><div class="clear options-subscribe-button-container" style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; padding: 0; margin: 0"><input class="options-subscribe-button button" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe"/></div></div></form><p class="spacing">***</p><p class="spacing">Thanks for reading!</p><div class="horizontal spacing"><div class="profile-picture spacing-small"></div><div class="vertical"><p class="br strong">Louis Barclay</p><p class="br">Founder of Nudge</p><p>louis@nudgeware.io</p></div></div></div></div></body><script src="../../config.js"></script><script src="../../js/background/storage.js"></script><script src="../../js/helpers.js"></script><script src="../../js/support.js"></script></html>
