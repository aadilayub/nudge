        h1.spacing What's new in Nudge
        h2 1. Add your daily goal
        p The slider page now asks the simple question 'What do you want to do today?'.
        p.spacing-m Click on it and you'll be able to put in your daily goal, which will reset at midnight.
        img(src="../../img/preview/goal.gif").preview-image.spacing-m
        p This is inspired by your suggestions that Nudge should help nudge you towards good stuff, not just away from bad stuff.
        .p-highlight
          p ‚≠ê Tip: the goal doesn't have to be work-related. 'Go for a walk at lunchtime' could make you happier than 'Reply to boss's passive aggressive email'!
        h2 2. You can now schedule Nudge
        p The new 
          a(href="./scheduler.html#options" target="_blank") Scheduler
          |  feature lets you set up active times and active days for Nudge.
        p Thanks to the users who suggested this!
        h2 3. YouTube Autoplay Stopper
        p Nudge now includes a new feature, the 
          a(href="./youtubeautoplaystopper.html#options" target="_blank") YouTube Autoplay Stopper
          | .
        p Enable it 
          a(href="./youtubeautoplaystopper.html#options" target="_blank") here
          |  and you'll no longer be sucked into a downward spiral of YouTube recommended videos.
        h2 4. Asking you to become Co-CEO
        p I've simplified supporting Nudge.
        p Now, I have just one ask: 
          a(href="./support.html" target="_blank") become Co-CEO of Nudge
          | .
        p In addition to the huge boost to your career, support banners in Nudge will be hidden.
        p Becoming Co-CEO costs $3 a month.
        p That's a bargain if you think about the kudos you'll get on LinkedIn for breaking into senior management at a sexy tech startup.
        p You can read more, and sign up, 
          a(href="./support.html" target="_blank") here
          | .
        h2 5. Many bugs fixed
        p.spacing As always, I've been fixing as many bugs as possible. You can report bugs 
          a(href="https://github.com/lgwb89/nudge/issues" target="_blank") here on GitHub
          | .
        p All these new features are in beta so please do give feedback on my email address (below).
