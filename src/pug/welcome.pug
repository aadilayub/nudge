  h1 Welcome to Nudge
  div.data-text
    p Hey! My name's Lou and I make Nudge &mdash; hope you like it. You can change what Nudge does, on which sites, below.
    p Important: Nudge tracks anonymised data, which I need to make it work better. I can't see any specific URLs or content that you look at, any of your activity other than on Nudge sites, or anything that identifies you to me. But I can see time spent on Nudge sites, and usage of Nudge features.
    button.toggle
      div.left.on That's OK with me
      div.right I'd rather not share anonymised data
    p Two more things. First, the only way I can keep working on Nudge is if more people use it. So if you like Nudge, please share it (
      a(href="http://nudgeware.io" target='_blank') nudgeware.io
      | ). Second, I really need your feedback to make Nudge better, so please get in touch at lou@nudgeware.io with any thoughts.
    p Cheers, Lou
